# What is a array in JavaScript ?
An array is an object that holds values (of any type) not particularly in named
properties/keys, but rather in numerically indexed positions.

In JavaScript, an array is an ordered list of values. Each value is called an element
specified by an index.First, an array can hold values of mixed types.

An array is a special variable, which can hold more than one value:

# Chage element in array

You can also add elements or change the elements by accessing the index value. Suppose
an array has two elements. If you try to add an element at index 3 (fourth element), the
third element will be undefined.
